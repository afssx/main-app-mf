## Running

Install `pnpm` as per instructions provided [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Run `pnpm install`, and `pnpm run dev`. This will build and serve both `main` and `module` on ports 2000, 3000 respectively.

- HOST: [localhost:5000](http://localhost:2000/)
- REMOTE: [localhost:5001](http://localhost:3000/)

`CTRL + C` can only stop the host server. You can run `pnpm stop` to stop all services.
